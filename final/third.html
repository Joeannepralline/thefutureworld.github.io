<h1><b><center>CLIMATE CHANGES!!!</center></h1></b>
<figure align=center><img src="cli1.jpg" height="400" width="600"><br>
<font size=5>Earth's climate has been through a lot over the past few billion years...
and at this point scientists have a pretty good handle on how our planet
has changed over time. But when we talk about the future of the climate too, about
how its changing more quickly than in the past and about the dangers it has in the past and more sever 
droughts and storms.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font>Some of the questions which commonly asked:
<ul>
<li>Will droughts in South Africa affest the crops of their farmers in the future?
<li>Whil the country of maldives be completly swallowed by the rising sead?<br>
<font>Some predictions have been made its a delimma either the prople
in the future will understand what it is to keep the atmosphere cleaner or they will
pollute it more.
HOWEVER Global warming predictions say that...
If the Glogal Warming increases, The temperature of the surface of the
ocean does too.And warm ocean water is hurrican fuel..
WE've known that the earth wasn't just a damp cylinder.
But as our ability to model the climate has improved over the time
We've learned about how our planet works and what we're doing to it.

Scary!<br></b>
<font size=5 face="Monotype Corsiva">The environmental threats that have defined our future 
are now threatening our presence! News media tell us about the effects 
of climate change but one article said that many people in the drought-affected areas
cried helplessly. "Take our God but please don't touch our water.". This 
shows how desperate people already are in parts of the earth today...
We've got to take every possible action because as the Doomsday Clock says
its just two minutes to midnight.

<h1><b><center>ATHEISM!!!</center></h1></b>
<figure align=center><img src="humanity.jpg" height="400" width="600"><br>
<font size=5 face="Monotype Corsiva"><p>Atheism is the belief that God does not exist. On an average 7% of the world's population 
comprises of atheists.</p>
<p>The future world will surely witness a drastic increase in this population of atheists as they will not have time to think of god the the busy world of tomorrow</p>
<p>All children are born atheists, they have no idea of god and their innocence is what depicts the meaning of ATHEISM. If the world 
of tomorrow accepts atheism, it could actually solve countless problems which we are currently facing. If prople forget what rligion is they
would eventually treat each others as equals and a new religion humanity will be born, Religious wars such as the India Pakistan rivalry
would end and no one would have to cry over the graves of their loved ones.
