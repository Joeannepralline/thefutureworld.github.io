world of tomorrow students will have many mediums to learn from. In a country like India, Currently we have maximum population of the parents being narrow minded and 
hence this narrow mindedness of the parents also affects the thinking of the child of today. However in the future becoming modern will not mean by
wearing short clothes or maybe all Indian women to be allowed to wear jeans and tees but it has a relation with having a modern thought process
which makes a person smarter and intelligent. And this will make both the parent and the child of the future smarter.
